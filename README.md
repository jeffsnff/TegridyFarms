# TegridyFarms
This was just a fun website I threw together in my coding boot camp at V School. 
The project was create a front end website that does an API call. Most students did a weather app, but I wanted to have more fun.
I decided to do it using The Strain API that is sadly no longer maintained so it broke my API calls.

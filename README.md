This project is my first frontend development endeavor, built using **React.js**. The application showcases a sleek and functional interface for discovering cannabis strains. However, the API did eventually get shut down. I spent some time in 2023 trying to find a new API and getting it to work, but with work and life, I was not able to accomplish it. I am still very proud of this website project and want to showcase it. 

## Features
- A dynamic user interface designed with React components.
- Responsive design for a seamless experience on any device.

## Development Journey
Initially, the project relied on standard `<a>` tags for navigation. As I became familiar with React, I refactored the codebase to use React components. Each component receives props such as:
- The link URL.
- Corresponding CSS styles.
- The name of the link.

This transition improved maintainability and modularity of the code, making it more aligned with modern React practices.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tegridy-farms-strain-finder.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd tegridy-farms-strain-finder
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Lessons Learned
- Transitioning from standard HTML tags to React components for better code reuse and readability.
- Understanding the power of props in React to create flexible, customizable components.

## Future Improvements ( IF I ever get around to it )
- Add a backend to see and store strain information dynamically.
- Implement a search and filtering feature for better user interaction.
- Add a real contact page.

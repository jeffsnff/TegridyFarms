These are my project ideas to continue building this.


I might have to use Route, so that I can do something like amazon product page and then detail page.
I want to create a splash page while my page is loading or doing a search for api? I would have to do a set time out function

Ideas to implament

-Shopping cart 
-loading screen for products (towelly smoking)
-save to local storage while in shopping cart 
-filter based on race ( hybrid, inca, etc)
-when submit shopping cart, print out reciept
-tour description and selection which goes to shopping cart
-maybe another product page for tshirts and such 
-user login 
    - admin
    - customer
- censor button that censors the `bad` stuff and then replaces it with chinese things.
